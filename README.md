Built a simple calculator using Python as part of my learning process

Python-based Calculator script packaged as a function. 
#specifications.  
1.	When called, the function will: 
  a.	Prompt the user to select a compute function. 
    i.	Multiplication 
    ii.	Addition 
    iii.	Division
  	iv. Subtraction 
    v.	Exponential 
    vi.	Square Root 
    vii.	Floor Division (Quotient) 
    viii.	Modulus operation (Remainder) 
    ix.	Combination of Operations (Multi-Operation) 
    x.	Mean of a list 
    xi.	Sum of a list 
    xii.	Median value of a list 
    xiii.	Multiplication of a list 
  b.	Prompt the user to provide Operands (values to compute) 
    i.	The calculator should be able to accept single values (e.g. 4 + 9) 
    ii.	The Calculator should also be able to accept as input, a list of values separated by comma as Operand.  
    iii.	operand. (e.g., sum of the list [2,4,5,6, 45,21] 
  c.	The Calculator will process the input and print out the results to screen. 
2.	The calculator will have a memory capability to store the input and results of the last 10 computations done on it. 
  a.	The user will be able to recall any of the last 10 calculations done on it
